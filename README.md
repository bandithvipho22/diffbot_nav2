# Objective
+ Create  robot to move autonomously 
+ Detecting and avoiding obstacles, capability to navigate around obstacle
+ Integrate with other components of the robot, and to test in physical world
+ Support human interaction for tasks: 
  - Setting goals
  - Emergency stops, or overriding when necessary
# Output
+ Using navigation algorithm to facilitate that problems by following ROS2 Navigation (Nav2) frame works.
# Scope of Works
+ Create a virtual environment (build world)
+ Setup the model of robot in gazebo
+ Create map using SLAM
+ Configure parameters in nav2 framework and deploy in robot
+ Create path planning using A* and Path tracking using P-controller and Pure pursuit controller
